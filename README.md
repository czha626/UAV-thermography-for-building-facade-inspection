# UAV-thermography-for-building-facade-inspection

This repository contains co-registered RGB and thermal images collected by a UAV for building facade inspection.

The dataset mainly includes co-registered RGB and thermal images collected during a laboratory investigation and field experiment on a pre-1920 mansory building. The UAV adopted is the Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual manufactured by Da-Jiang Innovation (DJI). The thermal images are calibrated, and the rectified thermal images are provided. The Homography transformation matrix, bridging the RGB and rectified thermal images, is also provided in the TXT file.
For images collected during laboratory investigation, detailed experiment conditions, such as the interior and exterior temperatures, ground sampling distance (GSD) of the collected thermal images, and UAV oblique angle, have been documented in the EXCEL file.
